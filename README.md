# Vehicle-Booking-System
This project is a simple web-based vehicle booking system developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to fill out a form to book a vehicle for travel, providing details such as their name, contact number, departure city, destination, type of vehicle, and the pickup and return dates.
# Features and Functionalities
The Vehicle Booking System is a web-based application for booking vehicles. It allows users to enter essential details like name, contact number, departure city, destination, vehicle type, and travel dates. The application validates the inputs and dynamically displays the booking details on the same page. The transparent booking form enhances aesthetics by showcasing a background image, while the responsive design ensures usability across devices. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates real-time interaction, field validation, and dynamic content management, making it suitable for showcasing front-end web development skills.

# limitations
No Backend Integration:

The system operates entirely on the frontend and does not save booking data permanently.
Refreshing the page will erase all entered data.
Validation Constraints:

Basic field validation is present but lacks advanced checks (e.g., ensuring valid contact numbers or logical date ranges).
Limited Error Handling:

Errors during user interaction, like selecting past dates, are not handled.
No Real-Time Availability Check:

The system does not check for vehicle availability, which could lead to overbooking.
Scalability Issues:

Suitable only for small-scale demonstrations, not for real-world use without a backend.
Static Design:

The form design and background image are static, offering limited customization.
